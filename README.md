🚀 E-commerce Sales Analysis Project Roadmap

🔹 Step 1: Understand the Objective

We want to analyze sales performance and answer questions like:

Which products/customers generate the most revenue?

What are the monthly/seasonal sales trends?

Which countries/regions bring the most orders?

Are there patterns of cancellations/returns?



---

🔹 Step 2: Get the Dataset

📂 Dataset: E-commerce Data (Kaggle)

Contains transactions from a UK-based online retailer.

Columns include: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country.



---

🔹 Step 3: Data Cleaning

Tasks:

Handle missing values (especially CustomerID).

Remove canceled/refunded orders (InvoiceNo starting with "C").

Convert InvoiceDate → proper datetime.

Create new columns:

TotalPrice = Quantity × UnitPrice

Month, Year, DayOfWeek from InvoiceDate.

🔹 Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Questions to answer:

1. Overall sales performance → Monthly revenue trend.


2. Top products → Most sold items by quantity & revenue.


3. Customer analysis → Who are the top 10 customers by spending?


4. Country analysis → Which countries buy the most?


5. Time patterns → Which days/hours get the most orders?



Tools:

Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Optional: Power BI / Tableau for dashboards



---

🔹 Step 5: Advanced Analytics (Optional but Good)

RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) → customer segmentation.

Basket Analysis (Market Basket Analysis) → which products are frequently bought together.

Sales Forecasting → Predict next month’s revenue using ARIMA/Prophet.



---

🔹 Step 6: Visualization & Dashboard

Bar charts → Top 10 products/customers.

Line chart → Monthly revenue trend.

Heatmap → Orders by Day of Week & Hour.

World map → Revenue by country.

Dashboard (Power BI/Tableau/Streamlit).

🔹 Step 7: Insights & Storytelling

Examples of insights you might find:

“Most sales come from the UK, but Germany and France are growing markets.”

“November and December show peak sales → holiday season effect.”

“Top 5% of customers contribute to 40% of revenue.”

“Certain product bundles (like candles + gift sets) are often bought together.”
